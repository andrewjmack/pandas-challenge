    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - School and student data sets were utilized to perform analysis across the school district based on reading and math scores, passing rates, grade (9-12) and school type (charter or district), size and budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Comprised of (15) schools, the school district overall boasts higher average scores and passing rates for reading than for math. As would be expected, the percentage of students in the school district passing both math and reading is lowest.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The charter school types are all smaller by size (number of students) than any of the district school types (i.e., the district school types all have larger student populations than any of the charter schools).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - On a per school basis, the top five schools by overall passing rate are all of the charter school type, while the bottom five schools are all district school types.    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - By and large those top performing charter schools also have a lower per student budget than the bottom five district schools (with the exceptions of charter Thomas High School ($638/student) and district Rodriguez High School ($637/student).\n",
    "\n",
    "    -No significant trends in math or reading scores were detected across grades (i.e., student classes 9-12); scores were relatively flat from 9th through 12th grades by school. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - The Scores by School Spending summary further suggests that with increases in per student spending, all scores and passing rates decrease.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - The Scores by School Size sumary generally suggests that students in smaller schools perform better than larger schools with the exception of medium schools and small schools having roughly the same overall passing rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - By school type, the charter schools have higher average math and reading scores than the district schools. Charter students also have higher passing rates than their district peers in math and in reading. However, the combined passing rates (students that pass both math and reading) stand out as the most significant indicator of outperformance by school type (90% vs. 53%, respectively).\n",
